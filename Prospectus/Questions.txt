Topic : Prospectus defense questions
====================================
* strong and weak lensing
* luminosity distance
* doppler effect
* what is shear (shear e1 and e2)
* what is reduced shear
* does lensing depend on mass of lens (yes, alpha depends on mass)
* hubble equation
* sed plot
* how to measure distance
* why 90 degree rotated ==> to minimize the bias due to intrinsic alignment of the galaxies
* psf convolution makes more rounder
* Î»CDM model

physics why we do this
erat and grat plot
erat, plot bias above 1.0
