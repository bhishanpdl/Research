## For citation
Go to [adsabs example](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016A%26A...594A..13P) and export the bib file to clipboard or to the `.bbl` file.  
Paste the contents to the `.bib` file in overleaf, rename reference name and use `cite{paper_2018}` and so on.  
Using bib files from zotero may fail. For example for Planck 2016 paper it fails.

## To view bib files highlighted in vscode
Install `bibtex language`.
