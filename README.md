# Research

## For citation
Go to [adsabs example](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016A%26A...594A..13P) and export the bib file to clipboard or to the `.bbl` file.  
Paste the contents to the `.bib` file in overleaf, rename reference name and use `cite{paper_2018}` and so on.  
Using bib files from zotero may fail. For example for Planck 2016 paper it fails.

## To view bib files highlighted in vscode
Install `bibtex language`.


## Searching Papers
- [Astrophysical Data System ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) (This can search paid paper in MNRAS etc. for free arxiv pdf docuemnts.
- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)

### Physical Review Journal D
Example:
```
lima, m. & hu, w. 2004, phys. rev. d, 70, 043504

Google will give some link to the Physical Review Journal D, volume 70 issue 4.
Go to [that link](https://journals.aps.org/prd/issues/70/4) and search lima.
